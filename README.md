# Hi, I'm Cailong Hua! ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Salaphaka Lab](http://salapakalab.ece.umn.edu/) at the University of Minnesota. I received my Master's degree in Control System with Distinction from Imperial College London. I obtained Bachelor's degrees in Automation Engineering from Politecnico di Milano in Italy and from Electronic Information and Engineering from Tongji University in China. 

My primary research interests encompass control systems, statistical mechanics, biophysics, and machine learning. My work focuses on developing both experimental and analytical tools to model the mechanical properties of proteins at the single-molecule scale, as well as advancing AI methods to better understand single-molecule data.
